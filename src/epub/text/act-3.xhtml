									<span>The undiscover’d country from whose bourn</span>

									<br/>
									<span>And makes us rather bear those ills we have</span>

									<span>The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Hyperion’s curls; the front of Jove himself;</span>

									<span>An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,</span>

									<br/>
									<span>You cannot call it love; for at your age</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The hey-day in the blood is tame, it’s humble,</span>

									<span>And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>Or but a sickly part of one true sense</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Could not so mope.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,</span>
