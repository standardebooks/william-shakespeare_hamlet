									<span>To be, or not to be, that is the question,</span>

									<span>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</span>

									<br/>
									<span>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Must give us pause: there’s the respect</span>

									<span>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,</span>

									<span>The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay,</span>

									<br/>
									<span>The undiscover’d country from whose bourn</span>

									<span>No traveller returns, puzzles the will</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And makes us rather bear those ills we have</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Than fly to others that we know not of?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And thus the native hue of resolution</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And enterprises of great pith and moment</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With this regard their currents turn awry,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And lose the name of action.⁠—Soft you now!</span>

									<span>The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Hyperion’s curls; the front of Jove himself;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;</span>
									<br/>

									<span>Here is your husband; like a mildew’d ear,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>You cannot call it love; for at your age</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The hey-day in the blood is tame, it’s humble,</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Or but a sickly part of one true sense</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Could not so mope.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,</span>
