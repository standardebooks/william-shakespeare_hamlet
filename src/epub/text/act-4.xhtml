									<br/>
									<span>Exposing what is mortal and unsure</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To all that fortune, death and danger dare,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is not to stir without great argument,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But greatly to find quarrel in a straw</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When honour’s at the stake. How stand I then,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That have a father kill’d, a mother stain’d,</span>

									<span>Excitements of my reason and my blood</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which is not tomb enough and continent</span>
