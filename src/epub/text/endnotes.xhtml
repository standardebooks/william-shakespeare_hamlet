					<p>In an effort to create a complete form of Hamlet, William George Clark and William Aldis Wright combined parts of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Hamlet</i> from both the Second Quarto and First Folio. This portion of dialogue originates from the Second Quarto but the verse line is missing a word. The printing of the Second Quarto skips a word making the line read “And either the devil, or throw him out.” Shakespeare’s original intent has been lost, and modern scholars have a variety of theories on what it might have been. Scholars have proposed “master” as a possible emendation. Other guesses made by scholars include “curb,” “lodge,” “reign,” and “seize.” <cite>—Emma Sweeney</cite> <a href="act-3.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Here we encounter another complication due to combining two versions of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Hamlet</i>. In the First Folio, the text is missing almost four lines of verse. These lines have been restored from the Second Quarto but the print was not perfect: a portion of a verse line was not completed. Scholars have proposed “So haply slander⁠—” as a possible emendation. Another guess made by scholars is “So dreaded slander⁠—.” <cite>—Emma Sweeney</cite> <a href="act-4.xhtml#noteref-2" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
